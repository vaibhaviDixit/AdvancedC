/*
The program defines a structure Edge to represent a weighted edge in the graph. It contains fields src, dest, and weight.

Another structure Graph is defined to represent a connected, directed, and weighted graph.

V: Number of vertices in the graph.
E: Number of edges in the graph.
edge: Pointer to an array of Edge structures to store the graph's edges.
The createGraph function allocates memory for a Graph structure and returns a pointer to it.

The printArr function is a utility function that prints the computed shortest distances from the source vertex to all other vertices.

The BellmanFord function implements the Bellman-Ford algorithm.

The shortest distances are stored in the array dist.
The algorithm consists of three steps:
Step 1: Initialize distances from the source to all other vertices as infinity except for the source itself.
Step 2: Relax all edges |V| - 1 times, where |V| is the number of vertices.
Step 3: Check for negative-weight cycles. If a shorter path is found during the relaxation phase, it indicates the presence of a negative-weight cycle.
The main function:

Creates a graph with the specified number of vertices and edges.
Adds edges using the addEdge method.
Calls the BellmanFord function to find the shortest paths from the source vertex (vertex 0 in this case) to all other vertices.
