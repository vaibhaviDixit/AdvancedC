/*
This code calculates the number of nodes in an AVL tree of a given height using a recursive approach.
The comments and descriptions added explain the purpose of the function and the main logic used to calculate the number of nodes
in the AVL tree. The code demonstrates how the recurrence relation for AVL tree nodes is used to determine the node count for the
specified height and then prints the result.
